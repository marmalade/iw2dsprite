Iw2DSprite 

This is a simple animated sprite class composed by CIw2dImage. It can handle rectangular sprites and iterate throughout while rendering each of them at a given position in order to create an animation.

Examples of use and test cases (not unit tests indeed, but sort of) are included in the unit_tests folder along with their project file.

Feel free to use this in any of your projects, just give some credit! Also contact me at leostera at gmail dot com if you have any comments or so.

Thanks!
